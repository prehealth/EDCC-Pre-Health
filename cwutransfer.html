<h2>Pre Medicine</h2>
Interested in becoming a doctor? Our pre-medicine pages contain useful information regarding preparing for medical school.

<h3>Things to keep in mind regarding pre-medicine at CWU:</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Pre-medicine is not a major. Pre-medicine is a set of prerequisite courses that prepare you for success on the MCAT and entry into medical school.</li>
	<li>Medical schools are looking for well-rounded applicants. While many students choose a field in the natural sciences for a major,  many applicants from humanities or social sciences are accepted into medical school. Choose a major that is the best fit for you. Your major should reflect a career choice you would find fulfilling should you not be successful in earning a coveted and highly competitive spot in a medical school.</li>
	<li>Students should seek advising early. While we can advise you on strong coursework preparation that will generally support your admission, we cannot be familiar with the specific requirements of all the individual schools. Please check requirements for individual schools as you prepare your applications.</li>
</ul>
