		<h2>Your Pathway to a Career in the Health Professions Begins at PLU</h2>

			<p>Pre-Health Sciences Advising at Pacific Lutheran University provides advising and support to students and alumni who are interested in exploring careers in the health professions including medicine, dentistry, optometry, veterinary medicine and other related fields. PLU is an exciting place in which to lay the foundation for a career in the health professions because of our academic excellence and rich opportunities for research and service.  The liberal arts education you will obtain at PLU will be an advantage at most schools, particularly medical school. With the exception of physical therapy, there is no formal pre-health major or academic track at PLU. With careful academic planning, you can major in any field of study and still complete the requirements for medical school and so forth. Many pre-health students do choose to major in the natural sciences; however, in recent years there have been students who majored in anthropology, sociology, Hispanic studies, psychology, and religion.
