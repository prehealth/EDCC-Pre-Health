							 	<h4>About the DO Pathway</h4>
								<p>“There are two types of physicians: MD (Doctor of Medicine) and DO (Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine). MDs also are known as allopathic physicians. Both MDs and DOs may use all accepted methods of treatment, including drugs and surgery, but DOs place special emphasis on the body's musculoskeletal system, preventive medicine, and holistic patient care. DOs often practice osteopathic manipulative medicine (OMM), the use of hands to diagnose illness and injury and to encourage the body's natural tendency toward good health. DOs are more likely than MDs to be primary care specialists, although they can practice in all specialties: approximately 65% of practicing osteopathic physicians specialize in primary care areas, such as pediatrics, family medicine, obstetrics and gynecology, and internal medicine.”</p>

								<p>According to the American Osteopathic Association, “osteopathic medicine is a parallel branch of medicine with a distinct philosophy and approach to patient care which focuses on holistic patient care, the unity of all body parts, the body’s ability to heal itself and preventive medicine.”

							 <h4>About the Dentistry Pathway</h4>

								<p>Dentists are responsible for the oral health care of their patients. Dentists diagnose and treat problems with patients’ teeth, gums, and related parts of the mouth. They provide advice and instruction on taking care of the teeth and gums and on diet choices that affect oral health. People come to dentists to have their teeth cleaned or to find the cause of tooth or gum pain. In a typical day, a dentist may fill cavities in teeth, perform surgeries to repair or remove teeth, and fit, design, and install dental appliances like implants or dentures. Providing dental care also involves taking x-rays, applying anesthetics, and writing prescriptions.

									<li>Physics</li>
									<li>English</li>
									<li>General Chemistry w/ lab</li>	
									<li>Organic Chemistry w/ lab</li>
									<li>Dental schools offer one of two degrees, the doctor of dental surgery (DDS) or the doctor of dental medicine (DMD) following four years of dental training. The two degrees are equivalent. As a general rule, the first two years of the dental school curriculum involve primarily course work, while the third and fourth years involve clinical rotations and training.</li>
									<li>While many dental school graduates opt to enter general practice immediately upon graduation, in other cases, they may opt for one or two years of additional education in a General Practice Residency or Advanced Education in General Dentistry program.</li>
									<li>Indicates the degree awarded upon graduation from dental school to become a general dentist. There is no difference between the two degrees; dentists who have a DMD or DDS have the same education. Universities have the prerogative to determine what degree is awarded. Both degrees use the same curriculum requirements set by the American Dental Association's Commission on Dental Accreditation. Generally, three or more years of undergraduate education plus four years of dental school is required to graduate and become a general dentist. State licensing boards accept either degree as equivalent, and both degrees allow licensed individuals to practice the same scope of general dentistry. Additional post-graduate training is required to become a dental specialist, such as an orthodontist, periodontist or oral and maxillofacial surgeon.

							 	<h4>What is a Pharmacist</h4>

							 		<p>The white-coated professionals at your neighborhood drug store do a lot more than just fill prescriptions. Pharmacists do indeed dispense medicines, but first they check for any possible interactions with other medicines or medical conditions. They also instruct patients on how to take the medicines and will inform them about what to do if certain side effects arise. A pharmacist will also keep meticulous records, coordinate with insurance companies, supervise pharmacy technicians and keep up-to-date with continuing education courses.

							 		Optometrists focus on all aspects of the eye. They deal with everything from detached retinas, to cataracts, to far- or nearsightedness, along with other disorders affecting the internal and external structures of the eye. Additionally, playing a role in the primary care of a patient, they can utilize eye examinations to identify hypertension and other systemic illnesses.
