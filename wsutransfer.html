		<h3>Prepare to become a health care leader</h3>
		<p>
			The MD program in the Elson S. Floyd College of Medicine trains you to be more than a physician. It equips you with a rich breadth and depth of experience that fast-forwards your understanding of the practice of medicine. In addition to preparing you to care for individual patients, it readies you to take the lead in addressing community health care issues. You learn to recognize problems in health care delivery, innovate solutions, and mobilize change that improves the health of entire population.
