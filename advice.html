				<h4>Documentation & Reflection</h4>

					<ul class='advice-main'>
						
						<li>Is this right for you? Take some time to really reflect if this is the right career path. Do you like working with people in this way? Can you imagine yourself being excited to do this work everyday? These pathways will require years of dedication and years of waiting until you finally are practicing on your own. Are you prepare to make that commitment? A big reason why people get into the healthcare profession is because they want to help people. You can definitely do a lot of that in this field, but there are plenty of other ways to accomplish that goal - education, engineering, research, the list goes on and on. When you find something that you are truly passionate, you will find ways to help others with the skills you have.</li>

						
						<li>Document shadowing hours that you have as evidence of your participation</li>

						<li>Reflect on experiences while you’re shadowing, volunteering, or working in spaces that give you experience with patients or exposure to the healthcare field you’re interested in. What were you thinking in those moments? What did you learn from your interactions? Did anything surprise you? These reflections will be key as you begin to craft your essays in your applications. 
						</li>

						<li>Develop an e-portfolio to document your experiences and reflections

					<h4>Understanding Prerequisites & Grades</h4>
							<ul class="advice-main">
								<li>For example, some programs will ask for A&P and/or statistics but not every degree program will require you to take those courses. Knowing what these requirements are beforehand will allow you to schedule them into your academic plan while you’re still finishing your degree. Many students do take time to complete prerequisites after they graduate with their bachelor’s degree, however, if you have the room within your degree program to finish classes before this - it’s recommended. 
								</li>
								<li>
								“You will be evaluated on both your cumulative grade point average and your "science" (biology, physics, chemistry) grade point average. While grades should not affect your choice of classes, you should be realistic in how you manage your course loads. Getting A's and B's in a 15-credit course load is better than attempting 20 credits and getting C's.” 
								</li>
								<li>Avoid establishing negative flags on your academic record (e.g. patterns of course withdrawals and repeats). Occasionally, there may be a legitimate reason for not staying with a particular class. Don't wrestle alone with your decision about what to do. Seek advice from your instructor, departmental advisors, the pre-healthcare professions advisor, and the Academic Advising Center when making critical choices and decisions. Advisors cannot predict what will be the right thing to do in the eyes of the professional school admissions committee, but they can help you identify and evaluate your options.
								</li>
							</ul>
							<h4>Choosing a Major</h4>
							<ul class="advice-main">
								<li>“Medical schools are looking for well-rounded applicants. While many students choose a field in the natural sciences for a major,  many applicants from humanities or social sciences are accepted into medical school. Choose a major that is the best fit for you. <span style="font-weight: 600">Your major should reflect a career choice you would find fulfilling should you not be successful in earning a coveted and highly competitive spot in a medical school.”</span> 
								</li>
								<li>Also, majoring in a field you enjoy can positively influence your grades. Why struggle academically in an area that you don't like or where you can't do well? Pursue your personal academic interests at the undergraduate level, because there will not be time to do so while in professional school. Try to get the most out of your undergraduate experience! 
								</li>
								<li>Pre-medicine, pre-health, pre-dentistry, pre-pharmacy are not majors. They are a set of prerequisites that you need to complete in order to meet the academic entry requirements for professional health programs like medical school, dental school, pharmacy school, etc. 
									<ul class="advice-secondary">
										<li>For example you could choose biology as a major but also be pre-dentistry. That means you will complete all of the requirements to earn a biology degree and are also taking courses (that may be outside of the degree) to complete the entry requirements for dental school
										</li>
										<li>See an advisor at Edmonds CC or when you enroll at a university, their pre-health advisor as soon as possible. Advanced preparation is key! 
										</li>
										<li>“Students should seek advising early. While we can advise you on strong coursework preparation that will generally support your admission, we cannot be familiar with the specific requirements of all the individual schools. Please check requirements for individual schools as you prepare your applications.”</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
							</ul>
							<h4>Connecting with Faculty & Letters of Recommendations</h4>
							<ul class="advice-main">
								<li>You will need 3-4 letters of recommendations on average, some schools will ask that you submit letters from faculty that you’ve taken a course from or even a healthcare professional in your intended field. Some instructors will not write you one if they don’t feel like they have spent enough time getting to know you and observe your work, which is why maintaining communication with your instructors and pursuing opportunities to work with them is advantageous </li>
								<li>Ask sooner than later. You want to give the person as much time as possible to write you a letter that really showcases your character, ability, and your potential as a future healthcare professional</li>
							</ul>
							<h4>In-depth Exploration & Shadowing</h4>
							<ul class="advice-main">
								<li>What you pursue outside the classroom will be considered by medical schools along with what you accomplish in the classroom. Keep in mind that no one particular extracurricular activity, just as no one major, promises to be a ticket into medical school. This gives you liberty to pursue and grow in extracurricular areas of your choice and personal interest. Naturally, many pre-med students migrate toward activities in the health care field, primarily seeking hospital volunteer and physician shadow experiences.
								</li>
								<li>Perspective for you to bring into an interview</li>
								<li>Being able to talk about your passions eloquently and clearly. Clearly defined goals and experiences to back it up will be a large part of your personal statement to these programs 
								</li>
								<li>Not all programs will require shadowing or volunteering but it makes you more competitive if you have those experiences to reflect on</li>
								<li>Taking a gap year is typical for students pursuing these pathways</li>
							</ul>
							<h4>Taking a Gap year</h4>
							<ul class="advice-main">
								<li>“The "gap year" is the period of time between your graduation from your baccalaureate institution and the start of medical school. While some students may not experience a gap year, many students need the extra year to strengthen applications, gain lab experience, pay down debt, or just take time off to experience life. If you are not immediately successful at gaining a spot in medical school, plan on a gap year where you will spend time strengthening your skills. Ideas for improving your chances of acceptance”</li>
							</ul>
							<h4>Do research on the professional healthcare programs available</h4>
							<ul class="advice-main">
								<li>There are many combined degree programs or direct entry programs available. These programs offer combined degree programs that give students the opportunity to obtain other degrees along with their professional healthcare degree. Combined degree programs expand career options, especially for those interested in careers in healthcare education, administration and research.
								</li>
								<li>Example: BS-MD programs (direct medical school programs). You apply to these programs when you apply to the university and if accepted can start at that school’s medical school right after you finish your 4-year degree. These programs are highly selective! 
									<ul class="advice-secondary">
										<li>“Why did you choose a BS-MD program?</li>
										<li>I became interested in being a pediatrician when I was about 8 years old. In high school, through both school subjects and clinical shadowing, my interest in medicine was fortified, and I knew that applying to medical school was in my future. I attended a high school where academic and personal balance were prized, so I knew I wanted a similarly full opportunity in college to pursue other interests before attending medical school. I learned about the Case Western Reserve University BS-MD program—the Pre-Professional Scholar’s Program (PPSP)—during my college interview at the university. It sounded perfect—a full four years of undergraduate studies (or a year of freedom if you finished your degree early), no required courses or major, the freedom to either take the MCAT® exam and apply elsewhere, or forego the stress and stay at CWRU. At the same time, I saw my brother, then a senior in college, struggle through the traditional medical school admissions process. I knew right then that this program was what I wanted.”</li>
										<li>Other common programs for medicine: MD-PhD, MD-MPH (Masters in Public Health)</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
							</ul>
							<h4>Taking Loans is Very Common for professional healthcare programs</h4>
							<ul class="advice-main">
								<li>Tuition will be different depending on the type of program and the school. Using medical school as an example, the low end will cost you about $35K per year ($140K over 4 years of medical school) and at the high end could cost you $66K per year ($264K over 4 years of medical school). Many students may not end up at school in their home state as well which may increase your educational expenses. For example a UW Seattle the resident tuition per year is $36K and the non-resident price is double that at $66K per year. 
								</li>
								<li>Many students will need to take loans to afford the educational costs, so be prepared for that. There are also many scholarships available for students as well. Put in the time to look for these and apply to them later on.</li>
								<li>Don’t let the cost of these programs deter you from going. After all of the effort you put into going through school, doing residency, internships, or fellowships, and you finally get the job that you’ve been working towards you will earn enough eventually to pay off the loans you may take out. The starting salary for many of these professionals are around $100K at least (depending on location) and will definitely be higher for fields like dentistry, medicine, and pharmacy. 
								</li>
